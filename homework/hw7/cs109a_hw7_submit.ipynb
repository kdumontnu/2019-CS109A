Here, we'll focus on the key idea of ANNs: they are able to learn a mapping from example input data (of fixed size) to example output data (of fixed size). We'll also partially explore what patterns the neural network learns and how well neural networks generalize.\n",

In words, the value of the transformed function at some point, $s$, is the value of an integral which measures, in some sense, how much the original $f(x)$ looks like a wave with a period of $s$. As an example, with $f(x) = 4cos(x) + sin(2x)$,  $\\cal{F}(s)$ is 0 everywhere except at -2, -1, 1, and 2, mapping to the waves of period 1 and 1/2. The values at these points are linked to the magnitude of the waves, and their phases (roughly: sin waves versus cosine waves).\n",

Thus, the network is attempting to learn a mapping from a 1000-entry vector down to a 4-entry vector. Our `X_train` dataset's shape is $N x 1000$ and our `y_train` is $N x 4.$\n",

    "There are several methods used to improve ANN generalization. One approach is to use an architecture just barely wide/deep enough to fit the data. The idea here is that smaller networks are less expressive and thus less able to overfit the data.\n",

    "However, it is difficult to know a priori the correct size of the ANN, and it is computationally costly to hunt for the correct size. Given this, other methodologies are used to prevent overfitting and improve ANNs' generalizability. These methodologies, like other techniques that combat overfitting, fall under the umbrella of regularization.\n",
